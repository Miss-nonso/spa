## **React Router and Single Page Applications**

### **React Router**

React Router enables seamless navigation in Single Page Applications. Key concepts used:

- **Route**: Define different paths in the application.
- **Link**: Navigate between routes without reloading the page.
- **useNavigate**: Programmatically navigate between pages.

### **Single Page Application (SPA)**

An SPA loads the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and dynamically updates the content using JavaScript. Benefits include:

- Faster navigation.
- No full-page reloads.
- Enhanced user experience.

## **Using Free Public APIs**

This app uses the **Spotify Web API** to fetch song data. Steps to use a free public API:

1. **Register for API Access**: Get client credentials.
2. **Authenticate**: Use the API's authentication method (e.g., `client_credentials` for Spotify).
3. **Fetch Data**: Use `fetch` or `axios` to make requests.
4. **Handle Data**: Process and display the API's response in your app.
